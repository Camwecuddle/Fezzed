# Fezzed
Translates english into the video game "Fez" language. It will return a .png file.
Simply run the program on the command line, type in your message, and press enter.
The png files returned are named result0.png, result1.png, result2.png, and so on using an int that is counting up in count.txt.
I plan on adding a feature where you can name your png.
I also hope to add an option where you can decide how many words per column.
If you are unfamiliar with the language, it is written top to bottom, right to left.
